My Dear Shankar, Warm Blessings

The 12th camp in India, organized on this sacred land of Pushkar, concluded the
evening before at 7 p.m. Though I couldn't fully benefit from this camp due to some pending
correspondence and attending a few public meetings here, I was able to make time for my
own meditation, and I felt that my Dhamma strength grew from this effort, and the mind felt
unburdened.

During Asoka’s time, an Arahant named Adinna meditated on this sacred land; some
historical evidence to this effect has been found. Since then, this entire region has been the
land of Buddha's followers, and this location was known as Buddha-Pushkar. I felt connected
to this serene place of hills and sand dunes. I felt profound peace while here. Those who
participated in this camp also derived good benefits. I am overjoyed to share my Dhamma
merits with all of you, including our respected mother and father and all other family
members.

Today, as the camp concludes, a recurring thought embodies the wisdom of this camp:
Gali di, mara mujhe, haya liya saba lita;
Jyom hi yaha cimtana chute, vaira jaya saba chita.
“He scorned me, struck me, oh dear, took all I had,
As soon as these thoughts fade, all hostility sheds.”

In our own madness, we indulge in such thoughts, defiling our minds with—oh, he
abused me, he insulted me, he shouted at me! Oh, he beat me up, attacked me, hurt me,
robbed me of all my properties, my valuables, and my inheritance, and turned me into a
beggar. Such thoughts roll around in our heads constantly, and as long as such thoughts
arise towards any person, our enmity with that person can never dissolve. Not only can it not
dissolve, but it continues to grow, flower, and bear fruit. If we are to uproot this poisonous
creeper, we must pull it out from the very roots, which will happen only when we totally let
go of such thought processes. As soon as these thought processes cease, the enmity ceases.

Let us see how such a train of thought can be removed. When the mind has a deep
impression of an act that was deeply wounding, these memories will continue to come up

during Vipassana meditation, totally clouding the mind. At times, our Vipassana moves on
the right track, and we watch these thought waves, these impurities, and these sankhards
(reactions) with a detached mind. This then gradually leads to their eradication. But at times,
panna (wisdom of impermanence at the level of sensation) weakens, and the mind gets so
caught up in these thoughts that the objective observation of Vipassana is lost. At such times,
these impure sankhdras, instead of being eradicated, go on multiplying further. But then,
as soon as awareness and wisdom develop once again, we remain equanimous. Then the
mind stops drowning in such huge waves of emotion. Where there is observation, there is
Vipassana, there is pavinid, there is understanding. With continued indulgence in thoughts,
ignorance surfaces with new sankhdras.

How do we avoid multiplying these deep wounds? Recalling Lord Buddha's discourse,
where he describes the four types of people in the world, can benefit us. First, those who are
moving from darkness to darkness; second, those who are moving from light to darkness;
third, those who are moving from darkness to light; and fourth, those who are moving from
light to light. When we understand this profound discourse of the Buddha, we see that we
are involved in the first and the third.

When someone uses abusive words, falsely accuses us, hits us, sees us as weak, attacks
us with their strength, and wrests our property from us, these are only causes of darkness
for us. In those moments, our present is devoid of light as pain and suffering engulf us. If
our parina is not present, if we are not alert and aware, then we multiply these moments of
darkness, filling the mind with such negative sankhdaras that not only fill our present moments
with pain but also become the cause of a dark future for us. Thus, we join that first group of
people who move from darkness to darkness, though what we really need to do is join that
third group of people who move from darkness to light.

This can happen only when our Vipassana, our paid is awake, and we continue to
remain with the Dhamma, understanding that these painful situations in front of us are not
due to any individual. Someone who is abusing, insulting, and attacking us in numerous ways
is not even remotely responsible for our miserable situation. This is our own unwholesome
kamma from this life or a past one ripening, giving its fruits, due to which our present
moments have become so unhappy. That poor person, due to his own weakness, has become
a mere tool in the hands of the rascal Mara, behaving in such abominable ways. He deserves
my compassion, as he is damaging his own future.

How can I get angry or feel aversion towards him? Oh, no! I need to be compassionate
towards him, fill him with mettd, and suffuse him with cool showers of goodwill, which
may bring up thoughts of Dhamma in him even as Mara overwhelms him in his weakness
and then slips away. He deserves our compassion, as he is damaging his future. This alone is

the way to his welfare. This alone is the way to my welfare. If pavifid has arisen as a result of
Vipassana, we know right away that the unpleasant situation we are in was unavoidable. Who
could have stopped it? If not this person, then someone else would have been the medium of
my misery, but it was inevitable that it would occur, as it was our own previous unwholesome
kamma that ripened in time, giving fruits. Who can change this law of nature?

The past is not in our hands, as we have no control over the moments that have passed.
And now it is pointless brooding over whatever unwholesome kammas we have done in
those moments. Those kamma seeds will ripen, and they are ripening now. And the present
moment, when it is bearing fruit, is entirely within our control. We are its masters, and we
can use these moments as we want. If we are devoid of wisdom, then we will misuse them
damaging our future. But if we remain filled with wisdom, then we will use these moments
well and better our future.

As we continue to practise vedandnupassand (observation of sensations) and
cittanupassana (observation of mind) unceasingly, we will be able to watch the current
sensations rising as fruits of the old negative kammas smilingly. Instead of giving importance
to immediate reasons, we will pay attention to nature's law and its truth, and as mere observer,
we will watch objectively the rise and fall and the movements that these waves make.

We should not get submerged under massive waves that rise in the ocean; rather, sitting
fearlessly on a rockabove, we watch the play of their rise and fall. And as Vipassana meditators,
so long as we remain objective observers, not only do we not make new sankharas, but the
miseries that have arisen as a result of the old sankharas do not get fresh fuel, and therefore,
they dissolve away.

By taking control of our present moments with the pure wisdom of Dhamma and using
it well, we are not only able to avoid a dark future but also make it effulgent with light. This
is how we move from the present darkness to a future filled with light.

Hence, it is clear that as long as we roll in thoughts of how someone abused me, hit me,
stole my, etc., we create and multiply our darkness in the present and for the future. But as
soon as we let go of this train of thought, we lighten our present, preparing for the sunrise of
our future.

I have myself gone through it, and all of us live it daily to a greater or lesser degree.
Hence, it is not difficult to understand how such thought processes have become routine.
It is very difficult to come out of such a state of mind, but not impossible. For a Vipassana
meditator, this becomes much easier to achieve.

Come, as this camp comes to a conclusion, let us firmly resolve to become well
established in Vipassana, to make our minds firmer and stable with increased panna. ‘This is
