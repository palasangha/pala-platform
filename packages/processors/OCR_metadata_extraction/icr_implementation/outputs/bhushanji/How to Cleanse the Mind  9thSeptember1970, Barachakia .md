Dear Shankar, Warm Blessings !

The mind feels immense joy in sharing the merits that have been earned from this
course in Varanasi with respected mother and father, all of you, and all other members of
the family.

The particular significance of this camp is that it was held at a sacred pilgrimage place
like Varanasi on the banks of the Ganges. My heart would be filled with compassion whenever
I, standing on the balcony at Dalmia House, would glance down at the river ghats and see
hundreds of men and women immersing themselves in the water of the Ganges in a surge of
emotion.

Oh, if only they had Dhamma wisdom, if only their wisdom was awakened, then they
would leave aside the need for support from these river waters for the purification of the
mind and instead practice something else that relates to the mind.

Not just in these times, but this belief that the waters of the Ganges have the capacity
to cleanse their mental impurities has been prevalent among people for thousands of years.
It would be understandable if the water itself was clean. But if the water is dirty, instead of
cleansing the body, it will only make it dirtier.

Where do these impurities stick? Are they stuck on the body? Had that been so, then
perhaps the river water would have washed them off, but they nestle in the mind. All the
mental impurities as well as all the mental wholesome qualities arise in the mind, and how
indeed can the water of the Ganges touch the non-material mind? How can it cleanse those
impurities? But when a person is immersed in the emotionalism of blind beliefs, then his
discerning eyes become blindfolded, and his wisdom, his pa/ifid is lost. There is no place for
the logical mind or a sense of discernment. Then the debate over whether something makes
sense or not, or whether something is true or false, cannot take place.

True Dhamma leads us away from blind faith and awakens our pa/ina, allowing us to
distinguish between dark and light and true and false. Blind faith cannot exist where there
is true Dhamma. Saddha, faith, confidence in the path of Dhamma is totally necessary, as
one cannot take a single step without it. But when faith turns into blind faith, wisdom and

insight are lost.

The Lord Buddha has enumerated five strengths for our success: saddha- faith,
confidence; viriya- effort; sati- awareness; samadhi- concentration; and pannd- wisdom. Here
we see that the foundation is saddhd, or our feet, on which stands the body of meditation
practice, while pavind is our eyes, our mental insight, which directs our feet to walk on the
right path. The union of the two is like the union of a gem with gold and is very beneficial.

I make the heartfelt wish that with the strength of merits accrued from Dhamma- dana,
may saddha in Dhamma grow stronger in all and may wisdom awaken towards liberation.

Blessings,

Satyanarayan
