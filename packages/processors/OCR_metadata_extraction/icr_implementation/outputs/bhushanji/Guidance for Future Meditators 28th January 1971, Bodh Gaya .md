Dear Babu bhaiya, Respectful salutations

I felt happy sharing merits last evening with Ma Sayama and, along with you all, the
other family members, the centre residents, and meditators at the conclusion of the course.

This retreat has been significant in many ways. Revered Sayagyi, upon leaving his phys-
ical form, not only entrusted me with a great responsibility but also endowed me with the
spiritual strength to bear it. Now, I clearly understand that it is imperative to become worthy
of this in order to utilize that incalculable Dhamma treasury so that we may take joy in it.
Now I have to remain firm on this Dhamma journey under his protective umbrella.

Due to the passing away of Respected Sayagyi, a number of meditators who were to
journey to Rangoon to meditate with him will not be able to do so now. Still, if a student
happens to decide to go there, upon receiving a telegram to that effect, you should make
arrangements for him to be picked up from the airport and taken to the meditation centre.
Sitting in the centre, whatever unwholesome kammas can be washed away will be beneficial
to all. Hence, all required comforts and arrangements for these students should be taken care
of. If they cannot carry their bedding while travelling, then this should be provided from
our home. Their meals, etc., should also be arranged and paid for by us. Put Banwari (Goen-
kaji’s son) in charge of taking them around the main sites of Rangoon. And should any one
of them be returning to India, then if possible, send a few Dhamma books from our library
with them; if not, then never mind.

Your Younger Brother,

Satyanarayan
