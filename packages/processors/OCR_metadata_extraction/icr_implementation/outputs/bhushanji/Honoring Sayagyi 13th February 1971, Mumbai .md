Dear Babu bhaiya, Respectful salutations

Many letters of yours await an answer. Perhaps in a day or two, I will be able to get them
written. For now, just a quick note on a couple of matters.

Please inform Ma Sayama, U Tin Yee, U Ba Pho, and U Chit Tin that I have decided to
establish an organization here: “The Sayagyi U Ba Khin Memorial Foundation” In the future,
whatever Dhamma activity is undertaken by me anywhere in the world, it will be undertaken
under this umbrella as a memorial to Respected Sayagyi. All Vipassana meditation centres
shall be known as Sayagyi U Ba Khin Memorial Vipassana Centres.

The Bodh Gaya Temple Management Committee has traditionally viewed the temple
merely as an archaeological site and a tourist attraction. However, my recent two-month
stay in Bodh Gaya and the Dharma camps held here have awakened a deep sense of Dharma
among the people. I have received profound empathy and deep affection from everyone. I
then made the decision to discuss with the organizing committee the idea of gold-plating
the temple dome and lighting it up similarly to how Pagodas in Burma do it. Prior to this,
the committee has turned down similar petitions from Ceylonese and other devotees on the
basis that the temple's significance as an archaeological site would be compromised. But now
that such a positive atmosphere prevails with the general public being supportive, I believe
I will be successful in this and that this endeavor will certainly be as per Sayagyi’s wishes. I
also wish that the expenses that this will entail should all come from Burma; the gold leaf
and the skilled workers too should come from Burma. I have faith that, via the Burmese
Consulate, I shall succeed in getting the government's cooperation for this. The donation
will need to be organized by the collective efforts of meditators there, which I don’t see as a
difficult prospect.

Dr. Bhikshu Dharmaratnaji, the editor of the English quarterly “The Maha Bodhi
Journal” published by the Maha Bodhi Society of India, had come to Bodh Gaya for Sayagyi’s
memorial. He has agreed to publish a special issue dedicated to Sayagyi U Ba Khin, featuring
content solely related to him. Similarly, another journal, “Dharmadoot’, from Sarnath in
Hindi, will also publish an edition on Sayagyi. We wanted to publish a booklet in his memory,
but if these journals do this, it will be so much the better. It will be necessary that a letter go

to Sayagyi’s disciples in Burma and elsewhere in the world on behalf of U Ba Pho to ask them

to contribute articles and offer their tributes to him for the journals, and then these journals
will be able to be published as per Sayagyi’s significance. This work will need to be done on
an urgent basis. For this, I too will make time and write a letter in English.

Your Younger Brother,

Satyanarayan
